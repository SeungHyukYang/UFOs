The purpose of this project is to build webpage that can be interactive with user about UFO sightings. It ables users to filter information by date, city, country, state and shape of the UFO.

## Summary
* One drawback of this webpage design is there are no further linkable sources that can provide deeper information of each cases. 
* Additional graph or map would be helpful for users to intrigue interest or to understand the tendancy of UFO sightings. 
* The design of the webpage could be more spacious especially at the bottom. Since it is heavily word intense, I found it less readable. It could redirect and split data to another webpage when user filters data.
